# [SariSend: QR-Based Payments on Aptos](https://sarisend.vercel.app)

> ðŸ“± **Mobile-first, but fully usable on desktop as well.**

[GitBook SariSend](https://sarisend.gitbook.io/)

SariSend is a user-friendly payment system that uses QR codes for fast, secure, and affordable transactions. It's built on the Aptos blockchain and is perfect for small businesses, like sari-sari stores, to easily accept digital payments without the high fees of traditional payment methods.

## For Everyone: What is SariSend?

Imagine paying for your groceries at a local sari-sari store simply by scanning a QR code with your phone. That's SariSend! It's a digital wallet that makes payments easy and safe for both customers and store owners.

*   **Easy to Use:** Just scan a QR code to pay.
*   **Low Fees:** Transactions are much cheaper than traditional banking or payment services.
*   **Secure:** Your money is protected on the Aptos blockchain.
